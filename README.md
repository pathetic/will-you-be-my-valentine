# 🌙 **Will You Be My Valentine? – Tarot-Themed Interactive Proposal** 🔮❤️  

Welcome to **"Will You Be My Valentine?"**, a **tarot-themed**, interactive web experience that playfully asks the big question this Valentine’s Day. Whether you’re looking for a charming way to pop the question or just want to have fun, this app blends creativity, mystery, and romance into an unforgettable digital moment.  

This project was my special idea for my lover this year, a unique and heartfelt way to celebrate love through an interactive and mystical journey. 💖   

## ✨ **Overview**  

"Will You Be My Valentine?" is a beautifully crafted web-based application where users embark on a mystical tarot journey before reaching the final question:  

**“Will you be my valentine?”**  

However, the answer isn't as simple as just clicking "Yes" or "No"—users must navigate an engaging tarot card experience before unlocking their final choice. And beware—the "No" button isn't as easy to press as one might think!
